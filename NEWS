3.3.3 - Dec 19, 2011
====================

Changes since 3.3.2:

- Instead of manually writing the libvirt's XML strings, we now make use of
  libvirt-gconfig to deal with the XML for us.
- Protect user from accidental deletion of boxes by providing an 'undo' button
  until after 6 seconds of deletion.
- Rely on libvirt for automatic assignment of unique SPICE port for new VMs.
- Don't destroy boxes on reboot.
- Also entertain medias of i686 architecture.
- Define a log domain for easier filtering of console log.
- Adapt to libosinfo 0.0.3 API for better OS media detection.
- Make the VM thumbnail in the properties view insensitive.
- Box creation wizard:
  - Make wizard topbar a real toolbar. This way, the window can be moved, and it
    can be styled correctly.
  - Only return from wizard to collection view if box creation succeeds.
  - Skip directly to 'Preparation' step when URI is passed through commandline
    argument.
  - Bump default storage allocation to 20 GiB.
    - This should be adequate storage for most OSs out there.
    - We use the dynamically growing storage format (qcow2) so actual
      amount of disk space used is completely dependent on the OS.
  - Special handling of live and unknown OS media:
    - Create initially transient box and only make it permanent if media
      installs anything on the storage.
    - Skip 'Setup' and 'Review' pages.
  - Only boot new VMs from hard drive after something is actually installed on
    the storage.
  - Accept path for URI as well.
  - More details at summary page on VM creation.
  - Express installation:
    - Actually update the settings after the first install of an OS.
    - UI to set admin and user password.
    - UI for specifying product key for Windows XP and 2003. Note that product
      keys are not required by recent Windows (Vista, 7  and 2008) installers.
    - Install QXL on Fedora guests to take full advantage of SPICE's efficiency.
    - Enable X/graphics for Fedora.
    - Add user to admin group for Fedora.
    - Automatically timezone and keyboard layout setup. This currently only
      works for Fedora.
    - Automatically language setup. Currently it only works for Windows 7,
      Windows 2008 and Fedora.
    - Fix user account setup for Windows 7 and 2008.
    - Fix some fundamental issues with Windows 2008. Now at least most of
      installation is automated.
    - Fix express installation floppy image and in turn express installation of
      Microsoft Windows XP.
- Added/updated translations
  - Polish
  - Swedish
- Various other functional and non-functional improvements and fixes.
